# Spanish Language Training Game

## Overview

This project is a Python-based interactive language training game designed to improve Spanish comprehension and conversational skills through immersive, scenario-based gameplay. The goal is to create a software experience that combines educational content with engaging gameplay mechanics, allowing players to practice language skills in context.

The game places the player in a series of missions where they interact with NPCs, respond to prompts in Spanish, and make decisions that influence the progression of the story. Each mission presents objectives, questions, and feedback to guide the player through realistic language exercises.

**How to Play:**  
1. Start the game and create a character profile with a name and password.  
2. Complete introductory briefings and tutorials.  
3. Advance through missions by reading NPC dialogue, typing responses in Spanish, and making choices when prompted.  
4. Mission outcomes depend on correct usage of keywords and decisions made throughout the scenarios.  
5. The game provides feedback, saves progress, and transitions to new missions automatically.

**Purpose:**  
The primary purpose of this software is to explore the intersection of game development and educational technology. By combining Python programming, Pygame graphics, and interactive text-based scenarios, this project demonstrates how software can be used as a learning tool while reinforcing practical coding skills.
